        <p>Master the game of Tic-Tac-Toe with these simple strategies and tips!</p>
        
        <h2>1. Start in the Center</h2>
        <p>Always try to claim the center square as your first move. It gives you the most opportunities to create a winning line.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Block Your Opponent</h2>
        <p>Pay attention to your opponent's moves and block them from completing a line of three.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Create Multiple Threats</h2>
        <p>Set up your moves so that you have two potential winning lines. This forces your opponent to block one, leaving the other open.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Watch for Corners</h2>
        <p>Claim corners early in the game to increase your chances of winning. Corners are key positions for creating winning lines.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Think Ahead</h2>
        <p>Plan your moves in advance and anticipate your opponent's strategy. Always stay one step ahead!</p>
        
        <h2>6. Practice Makes Perfect</h2>
        <p>The more you play, the better you'll get. Practice different strategies and learn from your mistakes.</p>
